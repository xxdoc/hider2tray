' OK, This function is confusing
' Many windows have different ways of handling Icons.
'---------------------------
'1. All VB apps use SendMessage(..WM_GETICON..) to get the Icon (not only VB apps)
'2. Other Programs like GetClassInfoEx(..)                      (most non-SendMessage Apps)
'3. Others Like GetClassInfo(..)                                (Very Rare)
'4. And the rest like GetClassLong(GCL_HICON)                   (The rest.)
'----------------------------
' Any program that doesn't work with these 4 methods have issues.
'
' All apps I have tried work fine with these 4 methods.. one or the other.
